**EssentialsX** is an open-source general plugin for multiplayer Minecraft servers. It adds over 100 in-game commands to extend and enhance Minecraft gameplay and server administration, including player-to-player messaging and teleporting, displaying server information and moderation tools.

I first became involved with the EssentialsX project as a contributor in 2016, at first adding a few small features and fixing minor bugs. In 2017, I joined the EssentialsX team and provided assistance to users in the GitHub and Discord communities. Then, in 2018 I took on the task of updating the project to work on Minecraft 1.13, which introduced major changes to the internals of the game and subsequently required considerable changes to the project.

As of 2020, I am now working on a total rewrite of the EssentialsX codebase which involves developing a new modular plugin framework. This will facilitate support for the latest Minecraft features, and also give server administrators more fine-grained control over which features they wish to use, all while improving the maintainability of the code and enabling more people to contribute to the project.
