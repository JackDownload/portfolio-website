As part of the Fundamentals of Game and Graphical Systems Development module of my degree, I was tasked with recreating Pac-Man, the legendary arcade title.

This project revolved around the use of an existing library developed by the university for 2D graphics, audio and mouse/keyboard input. For the game, I implemented 2D spritesheet animations, box collision detection and simple AI in C++, all performed within a standard game loop.
