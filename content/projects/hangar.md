**Hangar** is an upcoming repository for Minecraft plugins by the [PaperMC Team](https://papermc.io). It aims to provide a home for plugins built for the Paper server mod and Waterfall and Velocity proxies, and is based on SpongePowered's [Ore](https://ore.spongepowered.org) website.

My contributions to Hangar centre around the integration with the [Discourse forum software](https://www.discourse.org/), which allows PaperMC to share user accounts between their forum and the Hangar website, as well as enabling a basic discussion page backed by the existing forums.
