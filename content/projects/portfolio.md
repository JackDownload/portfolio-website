As a part of the Professional Development module of my degree, we were tasked with creating a **personal portfolio website**. The website is built using the [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) framework, and for design it uses the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and [Buefy](https://buefy.org/) toolkits.

The website is heavily data-driven, using the [nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) module to index projects without the need for a backend web server.
