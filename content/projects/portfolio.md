As a part of the Professional Development module of my degree, we were tasked with creating a **personal portfolio website**. I chose to build a static website with dynamic elements using the [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) framework.

The website is heavily data-driven using the [nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) module, which allows indexing and filtering of projects without the need for a backend web server.

The design uses the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and [Buefy](https://buefy.org/) toolkits, which are responsive and mobile-friendly.
