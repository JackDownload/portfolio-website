I'm an amateur game developer, currently working towards a degree in Computer Games Programming.  
I've programmed games using technologies such as C++, OpenGL, and Unity.

Outside of game development, I also lead development on the open-source [EssentialsX](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials) plugin for Minecraft servers.
