I'm an amateur game developer, having produced a [few small games](/projects/games).  
I'm currently working towards a degree in Computer Games Programming. You can see my various university portfolio projects [here](/projects/archive?category=university).

I also work on open-source Minecraft projects. You can see more about these [here](/projects/archive?category=minecraft).
